  # kubebuilder to get a properly defaulted ApiServiceTemplate struct if the

  # NOTE(gibi): We are not passing a Secret to the NovaAPI here any more. Nova
  # controller will push a Secret to NovaAPI CR automatically and NovaAPI will
  # hardcode which fields it will look at in that Secret.
  # TODO(gibi): Refactor secret handling that i) allows using Secret + field
  # selectors on the Nova CR level, but the NovaAPI CR should only take a
  # single Secret and no field selectors (i.e. field selectors will be
  # hardcoded). ii) The Nova CR should generate a separate Secret object to
  # NovaAPI. iii) Add usernames to the generated Secret.
  # NOTE(gibi): The ContainerImage, Replicas, NodeSelector,
  # CustomServiceConfig, DefaultConfigOverwrite, Resources are customizable
  # here but nothing else. Also all these fields has a meaningful default
  # value.
