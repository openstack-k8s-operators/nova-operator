  # NOTE(gibi): if apiServiceTemplate and schedlerServiceTemplate is not
  # specified still a CRs for those services are created with default
  # configuration.
  # NOTE(gibi): I don't see a way to define the apiServiceTemplate field with
  # kubebuilder to get a properly defaulted ApiServiceTemplate struct if the
  # apiServiceTemplate is not provided here.

  # NOTE(gibi): We are not passing a Secret to the NovaAPI here any more. Nova
  # controller will push a Secret to NovaAPI CR automatically and NovaAPI will
  # hardcode which fields it will look at in that Secret.
  # TODO(gibi): Refactor secret handling that i) allows using Secret + field
  # selectors on the Nova CR level, but the NovaAPI CR should only take a
  # single Secret and no field selectors (i.e. field selectors will be
  # hardcoded). ii) The Nova CR should generate a separate Secret object to
  # NovaAPI. iii) Add usernames to the generated Secret.
