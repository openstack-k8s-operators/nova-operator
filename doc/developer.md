# Implementation guidelines
This is a collection of guidelines for developing the nova-operator. The goal
here is to keep the codebase consistent and help spread good patterns
between the developers.

Please read the [developer guidelines](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/docs/blob/main/developer.md)
from openstack-k8s-operator first. Also use that doc for guidelines that are
true for the whole openstack-k8s-operator development and use this nova
specific doc for nova specific guidelines.
