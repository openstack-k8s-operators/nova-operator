# nova-operator

A golang operator for openstack nova lifecycle management

## Description

This operator is built using the operator-sdk framework to provide day one and day two
lifecycle managment of the OpenStack nova service on an OpenShift cluster.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use [openshift-local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### golang

this repo currently uses go 1.18

### pre-commit

This repo uses pre-commit to automate basic checks that should be run before pushing a PR for review.
pre-commit is optional but recommend to ensure good git hygiene.

#### install go if required

```sh
sudo dnf install -y golang
```

#### installing in a virutal env

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

#### golangci-lint

pre-commit is configured to run golangci-lint on each commit

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.50.0
```

add "$(go env GOPATH)/bin" to your path via ~/.bashrc

```sh
if ! [[ "$PATH" =~ "$(go env GOPATH)/bin" ]]
then
    export PATH=${PATH}:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
fi
```

confirm golangci-lint is installed

```sh
[stack@crc nova-operator]$ golangci-lint --version
golangci-lint has version 1.50.0 built from 704109c6 on 2022-10-04T10:25:07Z
```

#### confirm pre-commit is working

**NOTE:** this might take some time on the first run as it need to build the operator

```sh
(.venv) [stack@crc nova-operator]$ pre-commit run -a

```

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
make install
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/nova-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/nova-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
