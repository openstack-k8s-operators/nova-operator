      # Ideally we would add catalog-build target at the end but that requires
      # the bundle to be pushed to a registry due to opm limitations:
      # https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/issues/933
      # Having a local registry for the catalog-build is would require a
      # registry with TLS support or we would need to modify the catalog-build
      # target to add flags to the opm call. None of which worth the effort
      # since right now I don't how a change of this repo could break that
      # step.
